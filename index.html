    <p>My name is Aleksander Thomas Carr, I am currently enrolled in the computer software enginerring technology major at Thaddeus Stevens college of technology in Lancaster Pennsylvania.
      Welcome to my page where I will show you my projects I have worked on in this program and what I like also more about me and what I plan to do in the future.</p>
      <p>I have done projects ranging from easy to do projects to really difficult.
        I have worked as a group to do some of them.</p>
      <p>I was born on June 3rd 2001 in binghamton New york to a wonderful family
        and graduated High School in 2019</p>
      </p>A resume fully made with html and css that I made during my time
      at Thaddesu stevens during my first semester and was my first introduction to css.
    </p>
